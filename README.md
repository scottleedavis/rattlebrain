# RattleBrain

**RattleBrain** is a command-line tool, written in Rust, designed to bring the power of AI providers to your **Rocket League** replay analysis. By leveraging **[Rattletrap](https://github.com/tfausak/rattletrap)** for parsing replay files and connecting to one or more AI services (e.g., OpenAI, Anthropic, Google), RattleBrain extracts tactical insights, performance metrics, and actionable feedback to help you elevate your gameplay.

see the current [examples/feedback.md](examples/feedback.md) for an example of generated output.

also see the current [TODOs](TODO.md) for upcoming features.

## Usage
[Download](https://github.com/scottleedavis/rattlebrain/releases) and Run the latest release of **RattleBrain** with a replay file
```bash
./rattlebrain analyze <replay_file>
```

---

## Features

- **AI-Enhanced Analysis**: Analyze Rocket League replay files with the help of AI services for in-depth insights.
- **Dynamic AI Selection**: Automatically detects and configures available AI services via environment variables (e.g., `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `GEMINI_API_KEY`).
- **Unified Reporting**: Combines outputs from multiple AI agents into a single, comprehensive report.
- **Tactical Insights**: Highlights key plays, strategic opportunities, and areas for improvement.
- **Performance Metrics**: Extracts useful data points to track your progress over time.
- **Lightweight and Fast**: Built with Rust for performance and efficiency.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
1. Install **Rattletrap**:
   - RattleBrain uses [Rattletrap](https://github.com/tfausak/rattletrap/releases) to parse replay files, and is automatically downloaded if not detected in $PATH.  

2. Obtain API Keys:
   - Get API keys for the AI services you'd like to use (e.g., OpenAI, Claude).

3. Set Environment Variables:
   - Add API keys to AI Services in environment variables (at least 1):
     ```bash
     export OPENAI_API_KEY=<your_openai_api_key>
     export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=<your_anthropic_api_key>
     export GEMINI_API_KEY=<your_google_gemini_api_key>
     ```
4. Run RattleBrain:
     ```bash
      ./rattlebrain analyze ./examples/363cf8d9-8d7f-4c55-95a8-b97edbab0449.replay 
     ```

## How It Works

1. **Parsing Replays**: 
   RattleBrain uses **Rattletrap** to decode Rocket League replay files into a structured format.

2. **AI Integration**: 
   - Depending on the environment variables detected, RattleBrain connects to one or more AI services.
   - Each AI service processes the replay data, generating unique feedback and insights.

3. **Unified Report**:
   - Outputs from all AI services are combined into a single, readable report, highlighting tactical analysis, performance metrics, and key observations.
